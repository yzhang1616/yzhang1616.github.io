My research interests are computer algebra, symbolic computation, computational algebraic geometry, algorithmic combinatorics, 
and the applications of all that in the algebraic theory of differential equations, difference equations, knot theory and cryptography. 
The following sections describe my research plans in the future. 

\section*{The algebraic-geometric method for solving algebraic difference equations} \label{SECT:AODE}

An algebraic ordinary difference equation (\AODE) is a difference equation of the form
\begin{equation} \label{EQ:AODE}
F(x, y(x), y(x + 1), \cdots, y(x + m))=0,
\end{equation}
where $F$ is a nonzero polynomial in $y(x), y(x + 1), \cdots, y(x + m)$ with coefficients in the field $\bK(x)$ of rational functions over an algebraically closed field $\bK$ 
of characteristic zero, and~$m \in \bN$. We call $m$ the \emph{order} of~\eqref{EQ:AODE}. 
{\red add some motivations for studying {\AODE}s}.
We are interested in computing symbolic solutions (for instance, polynomials solutions, rational solutions) of {\AODE}s.
In particular, for a first-order {\AODE}, the corresponding algebraic equation $F(x, y, z) = 0$ defines an algebraic curve in the two dimensional affine plane 
over the field $\overline{\mathbb{K}(x)}$. A solution in a certain class of
functions, such a rational or algebraic functions, determines a parametrization of this algebraic curve. 
Thus, we may apply algebraic tools from parametrization theory of algebraic curves to study solutions of first-order {\AODE}s. 
Based on this observation, we propose an algebraic-geometric approach to solve first-order {\AODE}s: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item [1] Decide whether a given first-order {\AODE} can be parametrized with functions form a given class, 
such as rational parametrization;
 \item [2] Solve the corresponding reduced {\AODE} by using techniques from computer algebra 
and differential algebra.
\end{itemize}
This idea is inherited from the differential case and turns out to be successful for solving algebraic 
differential equations. For details, see~\cite{Winkler2019}. 
Using this method, we give an complete algorithm~\cite{VoZhang2019} to compute rational solutions of first-order autonomous {\AODE}s. 
Next, we will study how to use this algebraic-geometric approach to compute other types of solutions 
(such as algebraic solutions, polynomial solutions, series solutions) of first-order and higher-order {\AODE}s.

\section*{The improved holonomic gradient method via gauge transformation} \label{SECT:hgm}


\section{Contraction of Ore ideals with applications} \label{SECT:contraction}

\subsection{Introduction}
Let $\bK$ be a field of characteristic $0$. 
Consider the following linear recurrence equation:
\begin{equation} \label{EQ:recurrence}
 a_0(n)f(n) + \cdots + a_r(n)f(n+r)=0,
\end{equation}
where $a_i \in \bK[n]$ with $a_r \neq 0$, and $i = 0, \ldots, r$. The roots of $a_r(n)$ is called 
the singularities of~\eqref{EQ:recurrence}.  
There is a strong connection between the roots of $a_r$ 
and the singularities of a solution of~\eqref{EQ:recurrence} . 

It is well know that every singularity of a solution of~\eqref{EQ:recurrence} 
must be a root of~$a_r$. However, the converse is not true.
Generally speaking, the leading coefficient~$a_r$ may have roots at a point where no solution is singular. 
Such points are called
apparent singularities, and it is sometimes useful to
identify them. The technique for doing so is called desingularization.
For instance, consider the recurrence operator
\[
 L = (1 + 16 n)^2 \pa^2 - 32 (7 + 16 n) \pa - (1 + n)(17 + 16 n)^2,
\]
which comes from~\cite[Section 4.1]{Abramov2006}. 
In this, we use $\pa$ to denote the shift operator $f(n) \mapsto f(n + 1)$.
For any choice of two initial values
$u_0,u_1\in  \bQ$, there is a unique sequence $u \colon
\bN \to \bQ$ with $u(0)=u_0$, $u(1)=u_1$ and $L$ applied to $u$
gives the zero sequence. A priori, it is not obvious whether or
not $u$ is actually an integer sequence, if we choose $u_0,u_1$
from~$\bZ$, because the calculation of the $(n+2)$nd term
from the earlier terms via the recurrence encoded by $L$ requires
a division by $(1+16n)^2$, which could introduce fractions. In order
to show that this division never introduces a denominator, 
we note that every solution of $L$ is also a solution
of its left multiple
\begin{equation} \label{EQ:ah}
\begin{array}{ccl}
T  & = & \pa^3 +\left(128 n^3-104 n^2-11 n-3\right) \pa^2 + \\
          &   & \left(-256 n^2+127 n + 94 \right) \pa - \\
          &   & (128 n^2+24 n-131)(1 + n)^2,
\end{array}
\end{equation}
The operator $T$ has the interesting property that the factor
$(1+16n)^2$ has been ``removed'' from the leading
coefficient, which immediately certifies the integrality of its solutions. 
The process of obtaining the operator $T$ from $L$ is called
desingularization, because there is a polynomial factor in the
leading coefficient of $L$ which does not appear in the leading
coefficient of~$T$. 


In more algebraic terms, we consider the following problem. Given
an operator $L\in \bZ[x][\pa]$, where $\bZ[x][\pa]$
is an Ore algebra, we consider
the left ideal $\langle L \rangle = \bQ(x)[\pa]L$ generated by $L$ in the
extended algebra $\bQ(x)[\pa]$. The contraction of $\langle L \rangle$ to
$\bZ[x][\pa]$ is defined as $\cont(L) := \langle L \rangle \cap
\bZ[x][\pa]$. This is a left ideal of $\bZ[x][\pa]$ which
contains $\bZ[x][\pa]L$, but in general more operators.
Our goal is to compute a $\bZ[x][\pa]$-generating set of $\cont(L)$.
In the example above, such a generating set is given by $\{L, T\}$ 	.
The traditional desingularization problem corresponds to computing
a generating set of the $\bQ[x][\pa]$-left ideal $\langle L \rangle \cap \bQ[x][\pa]$.


\subsection{Main results}
Given an Ore operator~$L$ with polynomial coefficients in~$x$, it generates a left ideal~$I$ in the Ore algebra
over the field~$\bK(x)$ of rational functions. 

\begin{enumerate}
 \item We present an algorithm for computing a generating set of the contraction ideal of~$I$
in the Ore algebra over the ring~$R[x]$ of polynomials, where~$R$ may be either~$\bK$ or a domain with~$\bK$ as its fraction field.
 \item Using a generating set of the contraction ideal,
we compute a completely desingularized operator for~$L$ whose leading coefficient not only
has minimal degree in~$x$ but also has minimal content.
 \item Using completely desingularized operators, we study how to certify the integrality of a sequence and 
 check special cases of a conjecture of Krattenthaler.
\end{enumerate} 

This work is published in ISSAC'16~\cite{Zhang2016}.

\subsection{Future work}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Our algorithms rely heavily on the computation of Gr\"{o}bner bases over a principal ideal domain~$R$.
At present, the computation of Gr\"{o}bner bases over $R$ is not fully available in a computer algebra system. 
So the algorithms are not yet implemented. We would like to implement our algorithm in Maple or Mathematica 
by using linear algebra over $R$ as much as possible.
 \item Design algorithms for determining a generating set of a contraction ideal in the multivariate Ore algebra.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Apparent singularities of D-finite systems} \label{SECT:apparent}

\subsection{Introduction}

A D-finite function is specified by a linear ordinary differential equation with polynomial 
coefficients and finitely many initial values. Each singularity of a D-finite function 
will be a root of the coefficient of the highest order derivative appearing 
in the corresponding differential equation. 
For instance, $x^{-1}$ is a solution of the equation $x f'(x) + f(x) = 0$, 
and the singularity at the origin is also the root of the polynomial $x$. 
However, the converse is not true. For instance, the solution space of 
the differential equation $x f'(x) - 3 f(x) = 0$ is spanned by $x^3$ as a vector space, 
but none of those functions has singularity at the origin.

More specifically, we consider the following ordinary differential equation 
$$p_0(x)f(x) + \cdots + p_r(x)f^{(r)}(x) = 0,,$$ 
where $p_i \in \bK[x]$ with $p_r\neq0$, and $\bK$ is a field of characteristic $0$.  
The roots of $p_r$ are called the
singularities of the equation. A root $\alpha$ of $p_r$ is call \emph{apparent} if the
differential equation admits $r$ linearly independent formal power series solutions in 
$x - \alpha$. Deciding whether a singularity is apparent is therefore the same as
checking whether the equation admits a fundamental system of formal power series
solutions at this point. This can be done by inspecting the so-called
\emph{indicial polynomial} of the equation at~$\alpha$ and solving a system of finitely many linear equations. 
If a singularity $\alpha$ of an ordinary differential is apparent, then we can always 
construct a second ordinary differential equation whose solution space contains all the solutions of the
first equation, and which does not have $\alpha$ as a singularity any more. 
This process is called \emph{desingularization}. The purpose of our work is to generalize the facts sketched above to
the multivariate setting.

\subsection{Main results}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item We generalize the notions of singularities and ordinary points from linear ordinary differential equations to D-finite systems. 
 Ordinary points of a D-finite system are characterized in terms of its formal power series solutions.
 \item We show that apparent singularities can be removed like in the univariate
case by adding suitable additional solutions to the system at hand.
 \item Several algorithms are presented for removing and detecting apparent singularities of D-finite systems.
 \item An algorithm is given for computing formal power series solutions of a D-finite system
at apparent singularities.
\end{enumerate}

This work is available in~\cite{Yi2017}.

\subsection{Future work}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Generalize our algorithms for removing and detecting apparent singularities of D-finite systems to other singularities.
 \item Study the desingularization problem for the multivariate linear difference equations with polynomial coefficients. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Laurent series solutions of algebraic ordinary differential equations} \label{SECT:Laurentsols}

\subsection{Introduction}

An algebraic ordinary differential equation (AODE) is of the form 
$$F(x,y,y',\ldots,y^{(n)})=0,$$ 
where $F$ is a polynomial in $y,y',\ldots,y^{(n)}$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{K}(x)$, the field $\bK$ is 
algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, and $n \in \bN$. 
Many problems from applications (such as physics, combinatorics and statistics) 
can be characterized in terms of AODEs.  
% The laws of natural world are usually modelled in the form of differential equations. 
% In many cases, these equations are AODEs. 
% Or the problem of solving these equations can be reduced to that of solving AODEs. 
Therefore, determining (closed form) solutions of an AODE is one of the central problems in mathematics and computer science.
 
Although linear ODEs~\cite{Ince1926} have been intensively studied, there are still many challenging problems for solving
(nonlinear) AODEs. As far as we know, approaches for solving AODEs are only available for very specific subclasses. 
For example, Riccati equations, 
which have the form $y'=f_0(x)+f_1(x)y+f_2(x)y^2$ for some $f_0,f_1,f_2 \in \mathbb{K}(x)$, %(like: $y' = 1 + y^2$) 
can be considered as the simplest form of nonlinear AODEs. 
In \cite{Kovacic}, Kovacic gives a complete algorithm for determining Liouvillian solutions of 
a Riccati equation with rational function coefficients. 
% The study of general solutions without movable singularities 
% can be found in \cite{Fuchs, Malmquist, Poincare} for first-order, and in \cite{Eremenko2, Ince1926} for higher-order AODEs. 

Since the problem of solving an arbitrary AODE is very difficult, 
it is natural to ask whether a given AODE admits some special kinds of solutions, 
such as polynomials, rational functions, or formal power series. 
During the last two decades, an algebraic-geometric approach for finding symbolic solutions of AODEs has been developed. 
The work by Feng and Gao in \cite{FengGao, FengGao06} for computing rational general solutions of first-order autonomous AODEs 
can be considered as the starting point. 
% In \cite{NgoWinkler11b, GraseggerThesis, VoWinkler2015, VoGraseggerWinkler2017}, 
The authors of~\cite{NgoWinkler11b, GraseggerThesis, VoWinkler2015, VoGraseggerWinkler2017} 
developed methods for finding different kinds of solutions of non-autonomous, higher-order AODEs. 
For formal power series solutions, we refer to \cite{DenefLipshitz,SingerFormalSolutions}.
As far as we know, there is few results concerning Laurent series solutions of AODEs. 
Our main purpose is to give a method for determining such solutions.

\subsection{Main results}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item We present several approaches to compute formal power series solutions of a given AODE.
 \item Given an AODE, we determine a bound for the order of its Laurent series solutions. 
 Using the order bound, one can transform a given AODE into a new one whose Laurent series solutions are only formal power series.
 \item As applications, new algorithms are presented for determining all particular polynomial and rational solutions of certain classes of AODEs.
\end{enumerate}

% In this paper, we consider Laurent series solutions of algebraic ordinary differential equations (AODEs). 
% We first present several approaches to compute formal power series solutions of a given AODE. 
% Then we determine a bound for the order of its Laurent series solutions. 
% Using the order bound, one can transform a given AODE into a new one whose Laurent series solutions are only formal power series.
% The idea is basically inherited from the Frobenius method for linear ordinary differential equations. 
% As applications, new algorithms are presented for determining all particular polynomial and rational solutions of certain classes of AODEs.

This work is available in~\cite{VoZhang2017}.

\subsection{Future work}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Design algorithms for computing formal power series solutions of AODEs, which extends the classic Implicit Function Theorem of AODEs.
 \item Compute rational solutions of first-order algebraic difference equations by using the parametrization of algebraic curves.  
\end{enumerate}


\section{Desingularization in the \texorpdfstring{$q$}{q}-Weyl algebra} \label{SECT:qdesing}

\subsection{Introduction}

Prof.\ Stavros Garoufalidis, who is an expert for knot theory, 
presented the following conjecture in an email with the author:

\begin{conj} \label{CONJ:stavros}
(Garoufalidis): Let $J_{K,n}(q)$ denote the Jones polynomial of a knot colored by the $n$-dimensional irreducible 
representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and normalized by $J_{\text{Unknot},n}(q)=1$. 
Then, (a) $(1-q^n)*J_{K,n}(q)$ satisfies a bimonic recursion relation. (b) $J_{K,n}(q)$ does not satisfy a monic recursion relation.
\end{conj}

Using $q$-holonomic summation methods (as implemented in the \texttt{qMultiSum}
package~\cite{Riese03} or \texttt{HolonomicFunctions}
package~\cite{Christoph2010}) or by guessing (as implemented in the
\texttt{Guess} package~\cite{Kauers2009a}), 
we can always compute $q$-holonomic recurrence equations for $(1-q^n)*J_{K,n}(q)$ and $J_{K,n}(q)$, respectively. 
However, the equation for $(1-q^n)*J_{K,n}(q)$ usually does not satisfy the property in Conjecture~\ref{CONJ:stavros}. 
Furthermore, we can not see immediately that $J_{K,n}(q)$ does not satisfy a monic recursion relation.

In order to certify Conjecture~\ref{CONJ:stavros} for some specific $J_{K,n}(q)$, 
we develop the desingularization technique in the $q$-Weyl algebra. 

As an example, consider the $q$-holonomic sequence
\[
  f(n) = [n]_q := \frac{q^n-1}{q-1}
\]
that is a $q$-analog of the natural numbers.  The minimal-order homogeneous
$q$-recurrence satisfied by $f(n)$ is
\[
  (q^n-1)f(n+1) - (q^{n+1}-1)f(n) = 0,
\]
in operator notation:
\begin{equation} \label{EQ:qrecurrence}
 \bigl((q^n-1)\pa - q^{n+1} + 1\bigr) \cdot f(n) = 0.
\end{equation}

When we multiply this operator by a suitable left factor, we obtain
a monic (and hence: desingularized) operator of order~$2$:
\begin{equation} \label{EQ:qdesin}
  \frac{1}{q^{n+1}-1}\bigl(\pa - q\bigr)\bigl((q^n-1)\pa - q^{n+1} + 1\bigr) =
  \pa^2 - (q+1)\pa + q.
\end{equation}
The process of deriving~\eqref{EQ:qdesin} from~\eqref{EQ:qrecurrence} to called desingularization in the $q$-Weyl algebra.

% From this representation it is a routine task (but possibly computationally
% expensive) to compute a $q$-holonomic recurrence equation for
% $J^{\mathrm{twist}}_p(n)$ when $p$ is a fixed integer. This can be done either
% by $q$-holonomic summation methods (as implemented in the \texttt{qMultiSum}
% package~\cite{Riese03} or \texttt{HolonomicFunctions}
% package~\cite{Christoph2010}) or by guessing (as implemented in the
% \texttt{Guess} package~\cite{Kauers2009a}).

\subsection{Main results}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item We give an order bound for desingularized operators, and thus derive
an algorithm for computing desingularized operators in the first $q$-Weyl
algebra.
 \item An algorithm is presented for computing a generating set
of the first $q$-Weyl closure of a given $q$-difference operator.
 \item As an application, we certify that several instances of $J_{K,n}(q)$ always 
 satisfy the properties specified in Conjecture~\ref{CONJ:stavros}.  
\end{enumerate}

% In this paper, we study the desingularization problem in the first $q$-Weyl
% algebra.  We give an order bound for desingularized operators, and thus derive
% an algorithm for computing desingularized operators in the first $q$-Weyl
% algebra.  Moreover, an algorithm is presented for computing a generating set
% of the first $q$-Weyl closure of a given $q$-difference operator.  As an
% application, we certify that several instances of the colored Jones polynomial
% are Laurent polynomial sequences by computing the corresponding desingularized
% operator.

This work is available in~\cite{KZ2018}.

\subsection{Future work}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Study the desingularization problem in the multivariate $q$-Weyl algebra.
 \item Develop the desingularization technique for linear Mahler equations. 
\end{enumerate}


% In this paper, we determine a generating set of the $q$-Weyl closure of a
% given univariate $q$-difference operator, and compute a desingularized
% operator whose leading coefficient has minimal degree in~$q$. Moreover, we use
% our algorithms to certify that several instances of the colored Jones
% polynomial are Laurent polynomial sequences.  A challenging topic for future
% research would be to consider the corresponding problems in the multivariate
% case.
% 
% Another direction of research we want to consider in the future is the
% desingularization problem for linear Mahler equations~\cite{Mahler1929}, which
% attracted quite some interest in the computer algebra community recently, see
% for example~\cite{Chyzak2016}.  Mahler equations arise in the study of
% automatic sequences, in the complexity analysis of divide-and-conquer
% algorithms, and in some number-theoretic questions.
