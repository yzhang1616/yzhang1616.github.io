%\section*{\Large{Teaching Philosophy}}
%
%As Socrates said, “Education is not the filling of a vessel, but the kinding of a flame”. 
%A good teacher not only teach students key ideas and techniques of a course, but also motivate their interests so that they will learn and 
%study by themselves in the future. 
%Meanwhile, a teacher shall also show the general methodology for learning a course so that they know how to learn it by themselves. 
%There are general goals I want to achieve for my teaching. 
%Under this philosophy, I teach my courses with the following schemes: 
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Design lecture notes for audience. 
%Before my lectures, I investigate mathematical backgrounds of my students by checking their previous course lists online. 
%On the other hand, I also ask some of my senior colleagues about their experience in teaching the same course. 
%This is very helpful in preparing my lecture notes because with those information 
%I know how to organize the material so that it is not so hard for my students. 
%When I design my lecture notes, I first recall some key results in the previous lecture so that students 
%can have a  retrospect about what they learned before at the very beginning. 
%In the final part of my notes, I give a summary about all the ingredients of the current lecture. 
%After my lectures, I scan and submit my notes online so that students can download and read them for the convenience of their study.
%
%\item General guides in the first lecture. In my first lecture, I give an outline of the content of the course, such as: 
%what are objects we are going to study;
%some historical backgrounds of the topic; main problems and results in this area; possible applications in related areas. 
%Besides, I also give some general suggestions for studying: 1.\ read the textbook and attend my lectures regularly; 
%2.\ discuss with classmates and me (after lectures and during my office hours); 
%3.\ use library properly; 4.\ finish homework independently as much as possible (discussion is encouraged, 
%but plagiarism is definitely prohibited).  
%
%\item Balance between time and material. Each lecture has fixed time and is scheduled to teach one section 
%(sometimes a half one) from the designated textbook. 
%This requires the instructor or lecturer to prepare lecture notes with balance between time and material. 
%For instance, sometimes one section contains five subsections (or even more). 
%It would be very time-consuming to go through every detail of each subsection. In that case, 
%I always try to 
%summarize key ideas of each subsection and show students how to apply them to do concrete examples. 
%%If the time is still very tight, I simply give some remarks in the lecture 
%%and suggest students to learn that part by self-reading.  
%On the other hand, if the time is quite abundant, 
%I would give more concrete examples, details and some historical backgrounds of the topic during the class.  
%%After my lectures, I will scan and submit my lecture notes online so that some students can download and read them for the convenience of their study.  
%
%\item Teaching with concrete examples. 
%Mathematics is abstract because it contains a lot of definitions, lemmas, propositions and theorems. 
%I find that it is an excellent idea to teach with concrete examples, especially for those students who are not from 
%the mathematical department. Actually, classical examples not only illustrate abstract concepts and important ideas in mathematics, 
%but also show students how to apply them to solve practical problems. 
%Last but not least, examples help students understand, review and memorize 
%key points of materials in lectures.  
%
%\item Communicating with students. Roughly speaking, teaching a course is all about communicating with students, 
%exchanges ideas and thoughts with them. During my lectures, I always speak loudly, clearly and slowly so that my students 
%can hear what I am talking about. Besides, I also write in the backboard with large enough handwriting and 
%try to have suitable eye contact with students. Sometimes, they ask me some questions during the class. 
%I always try to answer their questions concisely and clearly. On the other hand, their questions, comments and suggestions also help me 
%improve the quality of my lectures and learn how to explain certain materials of the course in a more proper way. 
%Moreover, I help them as possible as I can through office hours and emails.

%%\section*{\Large{Research Plan}}

%%\section*{\Large{Teaching Philosophy}}
%%
%%As Socrates said, “Education is not the filling of a vessel, but the kinding of a flame”. 
%%A good teacher not only teach students key ideas and techniques of a course, but also motivate their interests so that they will learn and 
%%study by themselves in the future. 
%%Meanwhile, a teacher shall also show the general methodology for learning a course so that they know how to learn it by themselves. 
%%There are general goals I want to achieve for my teaching. 
%%Under this philosophy, I teach my courses with the following schemes: 
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item Design lecture notes for audience. 
%%Before my lectures, I investigate mathematical backgrounds of my students by checking their previous course lists online. 
%%On the other hand, I also ask some of my senior colleagues about their experience in teaching the same course. 
%%This is very helpful in preparing my lecture notes because with those information 
%%I know how to organize the material so that it is not so hard for my students. 
%%When I design my lecture notes, I first recall some key results in the previous lecture so that students 
%%can have a  retrospect about what they learned before at the very beginning. 
%%In the final part of my notes, I give a summary about all the ingredients of the current lecture. 
%%After my lectures, I scan and submit my notes online so that students can download and read them for the convenience of their study.
%%
%%\item General guides in the first lecture. In my first lecture, I give an outline of the content of the course, such as: 
%%what are objects we are going to study;
%%some historical backgrounds of the topic; main problems and results in this area; possible applications in related areas. 
%%Besides, I also give some general suggestions for studying: 1.\ read the textbook and attend my lectures regularly; 
%%2.\ discuss with classmates and me (after lectures and during my office hours); 
%%3.\ use library properly; 4.\ finish homework independently as much as possible (discussion is encouraged, 
%%but plagiarism is definitely prohibited).  
%%
%%\item Balance between time and material. Each lecture has fixed time and is scheduled to teach one section 
%%(sometimes a half one) from the designated textbook. 
%%This requires the instructor or lecturer to prepare lecture notes with balance between time and material. 
%%For instance, sometimes one section contains five subsections (or even more). 
%%It would be very time-consuming to go through every detail of each subsection. In that case, 
%%I always try to 
%%summarize key ideas of each subsection and show students how to apply them to do concrete examples. 
%%%If the time is still very tight, I simply give some remarks in the lecture 
%%%and suggest students to learn that part by self-reading.  
%%On the other hand, if the time is quite abundant, 
%%I would give more concrete examples, details and some historical backgrounds of the topic during the class.  
%%%After my lectures, I will scan and submit my lecture notes online so that some students can download and read them for the convenience of their study.  
%%
%%\item Teaching with concrete examples. 
%%Mathematics is abstract because it contains a lot of definitions, lemmas, propositions and theorems. 
%%I find that it is an excellent idea to teach with concrete examples, especially for those students who are not from 
%%the mathematical department. Actually, classical examples not only illustrate abstract concepts and important ideas in mathematics, 
%%but also show students how to apply them to solve practical problems. 
%%Last but not least, examples help students understand, review and memorize 
%%key points of materials in lectures.  
%%
%%\item Communicating with students. Roughly speaking, teaching a course is all about communicating with students, 
%%exchanges ideas and thoughts with them. During my lectures, I always speak loudly, clearly and slowly so that my students 
%%can hear what I am talking about. Besides, I also write in the backboard with large enough handwriting and 
%%try to have suitable eye contact with students. Sometimes, they ask me some questions during the class. 
%%I always try to answer their questions concisely and clearly. On the other hand, their questions, comments and suggestions also help me 
%%improve the quality of my lectures and learn how to explain certain materials of the course in a more proper way. 
%%Moreover, I help them as possible as I can through office hours and emails.
