      <h2>On (shape-)Wilf-equivalence for words</h2>
      The material on this webpage accompanies the article
      <a href = "shapwilf.pdf">
      On (shape-)Wilf-equivalence for words</a>
      by Ting Guo, Christian Krattenthaler and Yi Zhang.
     
     <p>
    <a href = "zof.m">zof.m</a>, a Mathematica package for generating
    0-1-fillings of a Ferrers board (shape), checking the number of
    sigma-avoiding 0-1-fillings of a Ferrers board, 
     generating generalized 0-1-fillings of a Ferrers board, 
     and checking the number of generalized 
     0-1-fillings of a Ferrers board with weight n
    such that the longest ne-chain has length u 
    and the longest se-chain has length v. It is based on joint work with Ting
    Guo and Christian Krattenthaler. For a demonstration of the package,
    see the <a href = "zof.nb">zof.nb</a> notebook.
